Curvature driven itg 2D using the equations in [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022377820000938]. Note that I am not one of the authors of that article, so this is not the code that is actually used in that paper, but presumably an equivalent one.

Note: 
Don't forget to execute:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to get all the submodules.
